My full name is David Gerald Norvell, this github serves at the moment as an archive for my work as i continue my education.

I have experience with SQL, Java (Oracle), C# and C++, though honestly C++ would be my pick.

You may reach me at either David.G.Norvell@my.occc.edu (School Email) or Dopplerdave97@hotmail.com ("Private" email), if you are an employer or other similar individual
looking for someone to do work i'd prefer you use the school email (Less cluttered).
